Code for calculating differential scattering cross sections on an arbitrary spherically-symmetric potentials. Useful for determining the shape-elastic component of nuclear scattering cross secitons, and for transmission coefficients to inelastic channels.

Main algorithm adapted from chapters 13-18 of "Theoretical Physics on the Personal Computer", by Erich W. Schmid, Gerhard Spitz, and Wolfgang LÃ¶sch, and Chapter 11 of "Introductory Quantum Mechanics", by David Griffiths.
